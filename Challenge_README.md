We were let known Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.  
In order to do that, we will go back to our previous analysis "file" to scan at what time of year when campaigns tend to be more successful.
First, we would like to compare the correlation between category hierarchy, so we can have the information displayed in layers - zooming from every Kickstarter campaign, then theater category to only plays campaigns.

From our last analysis, we know the month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. By outlining the parent category for theater campaigns, we can see that they follow the overall trend: there is a spike of successful campaigns that began in May, but that tapers off by the end of the year - trend that prevails in the three graphs. However, May, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed theater campaigns launched, and December being the worst month to launch. 
By charting only the plays campaigns launch date considering their outcomes, we can conclude that the best period to launch a play campaign is from May to June, in which the probability of success is around 70%. Remarking that the mean goal for these campaigns are around $5,000 and there is no entry data of a canceled play Kickstarter campaign. 
Next, we get to analyze the outcome based on goals. For this, the play campaigns were split in goal ranges and sorted as successful, failed and cancel. With this arrangement, we can see what the best suitable amount of money to crowdfund is to have a successful project. To enhance our numbers we would want to turn them into relatives counting the total of projects in each range. By doing this we manage to compute the following chart.

It is important to remember the relative quality in this chart, as we always want to see the total of campaigns in each range to see how reliable is our result, for example, the range 45000-49999, it has only one entry, which does not really say much about the potential of a goal like that. Therefore, considering all the variables involve, the most logical conclusion would be not to set a goal above $4999, as there are 529 successful campaigns out of 720 (73% success rate). 
Overall, according to Kickstarter, the best way to achieve a successful crowdfunded play campaign is:

•	Launch between May and June
•	Set a goal below $5000

It would be great to know the rating given by the public after a Kickstarter campaign is successful to evaluate the tendency of what is expected from a crowdfunded play.
